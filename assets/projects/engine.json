				"text": "I recently took on the project of building a small engine to learn about the inner functions and gain mechanical skills. I stripped it down to its bare components, and then rebuilt it all from scratch. Not only was it a great experience of learning mechanical skills, but I also learned about the functions of the engine and how it all comes together to do it's job.  Through the project, I took a few images that are shown below. This was a really fun project, and I learned way more about how a 4-stroke combustion engine works.",
