				"title": "Intake",
				"text": "This intake on our robot was designed to both pickup the balls, and center them in a specific location to handoff to the feeder. It is made up of three shafts, an ABS roller, a vectored intake roller made up of 3D printed mecanum wheels, and a shaft with two wheels to handoff into the feeder. All three are driven by a 775 Pro attatched to a Versa Planetary gearbox. The intake is deployed by two 6\" pneumatic pistons.",

				"title": "Feeder",
				"text": "The feeder was designed with the sole intention of getting the balls from the intake to the shooter. It is made up of 3D printer rollers and spacers running polycord between the shafts. It is run off of four RS550 motors.",

				"title": "Shooter",
				"text": "The shooter on our robot is based upon two 6\" flywheels spinning to propel the ball. The flywheels are powered by a Falcon 500. The hood over the flywheels guides the balls, and can change its angle based on the distance of the target. It is attatched to a worm gear powered by an AM-2235 Snowblower motor. The entire shooter is mounted on a turret that can pivot 270Â°, powered by a 775 Pro motor.",

It also doubles as our control panel mechanism, as it has two compliant wheels mounted on it. The mechanism is deployed using a pneumatic cylinder.",
